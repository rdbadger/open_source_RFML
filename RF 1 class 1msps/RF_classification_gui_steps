working directory for using python apps must be:

RF_class directory for ACE machine

* conda activate pytorch (not applicable to non-anaconda installs) Idea here is to make sure pytorch modules available

* MUST start program below in directory above dataset directory:
	a) python3 rf_stft_v1.py

choose sigmf-data file from dataset directory
1) first click on zoom icon to enable zooming feature
2) zoom in on area of interest
3) UN-SELECT zoom icon. MUST be done to make bounding selection
4) export saved bounding box. It will get saved to data directory. This is subdirectory of dataset
~/sigMF_ML/class2/dataset/data/UHF_lora250_snr_hi/sigmf-data

python3 chop_v1.py
open pickle file in: ~/sigMF_ML/class2/dataset/data/UHF_lora250_snr_hi/sigmf-data

choose width, height, and number of chops (pieces made from spectrogram) then push the 'chop chop chop' button

results will be put in directory that is named after height and width:
./data/UHF_lora250_snr_hi/chopped-data-113-113/ (113x113)
